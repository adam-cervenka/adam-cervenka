### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Adam. I study at secondary school and enjoy mathematics and computer science.

Among programming languages, I mostly use C++ (for algorithmization and competitive programming) and Python (for maths and shorter scripts).

I have also some experience with HTML and CSS, PHP and SQL.

I participated in CEOI 2022. [Here](https://codeforces.com/profile/adamcervenka) is my Codeforces profile.
