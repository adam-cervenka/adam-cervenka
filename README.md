### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Adam. I study at secondary school and enjoy mathematics and informatics.

Among programming languages, I mostly use C++ (for algorithmization and competitive programming) and Python (for maths and shorter scripts).

I have also some experience with HTML and CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL.
